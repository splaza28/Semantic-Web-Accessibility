Horiseon Web Accessibility Refactoring
Description
Horiseon is a Marketing Agency who is striving to make their website fall in line with current accessibility standards to better serve their customers. Optimization for their search engines is paramount. Website accessibility is something that has become increasingly vital over the last few years and everyone is making an effort to get on board to meet these requirements. The implementation of these standards can be easily achieved through simple modifications to their code base. Through the incorporation of Semantic Elements in the HTML and CSS files I was able to update the website to a version that is more accessible and user friendly.
